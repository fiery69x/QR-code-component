### What I learned

New uses of decimal & rem instead of px - e.g, 1.075rem. 
Better useage of CSS and prefixing tags such as --color-dark-blue to make things easier to search for further down the line.
Downloading & using font families using Google fonts.
Using grid as display and place-items: center.
Making sure to use max-width % & height: auto; for responsiveness.


```html
Having a greater understanding of using content="" to help with screen reader
  <meta name="description" content="This is a solution for the QR code component challenge from Frontend Mentor.">

Again, using alt="" text to help with screen readers. Setting a max width & height to help with reactivity further down the line.

```css
.glad to have learnt how to put soft edges on boxes with border-radius: 1.35rem;

    background-color: var(--color-white);
    max-width: 320px;
    padding: 1.075rem;
    border-radius: 1.35rem;
    box-shadow: 0 1.6rem 1.6rem hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.05);
    text-align: center;
}

### Continued development

Still working on understanding what tools are available using HTML & CSS to help with styling and achieving the desired end goal. GET GOOD IN SHORT.
